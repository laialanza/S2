1
00:00:00,205 --> 00:00:01,838
Welcome to Westeros,

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,012
where the fight for the kingdom is on.

3
00:00:04,449 --> 00:00:06,867
- Anyone can die.
- Which is fine.

4
00:00:07,263 --> 00:00:11,081
Where great families live
and die for the Iron Throne.

5
00:00:11,631 --> 00:00:14,681
They're all weaving these tangled webs.

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,235
Some are noble.

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,051
Jon Snow's everybody's hero.

8
00:00:18,064 --> 00:00:19,548
Some are not.

9
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:22,687
- If you're gonna be bad, be really bad.
- I want my crown!

10
00:00:22,807 --> 00:00:25,001
So many kings and queens in waiting.

11
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,759
It's about power and greed.

12
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:29,687
But an icy foe may well end them all.

13
00:00:30,838 --> 00:00:32,194
When's it start?

14
00:00:32,423 --> 00:00:35,365
Season seven is coming
and so are the dragons.

15
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:38,051
So let's burn through
the epic saga to date.

16
00:00:38,255 --> 00:00:39,944
This is what Game of Thrones does, it...

17
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:44,184
- it sucks you in.
- With Game of Thrones: The Story So Far.

18
00:00:44,304 --> 00:00:47,713
When you play the Game of
Thrones you win or you die.

19
00:00:48,717 --> 00:00:50,265
There is no middle ground.

21
00:00:54,415 --> 00:00:58,187
As season one opens, it's
the calm before the storm.

22
00:00:58,872 --> 00:01:02,210
King Robert Baratheon rules
from the capital King's Landing

23
00:01:02,242 --> 00:01:04,103
but his days are numbered.

24
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,787
To be king in Westeros, you sit on
the Iron Throne in King's Landing

25
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:09,636
and you're ruling over
the Seven Kingdoms.

26
00:01:09,655 --> 00:01:12,954
Start the damn joust
before I piss meself!

27
00:01:13,492 --> 00:01:15,648
He's locked in a loveless marriage

28
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:18,322
and only chose his queen
for her family's name

29
00:01:18,373 --> 00:01:20,247
to hold his kingdom together.

30
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:23,636
I'm very sympathetic to Cersei.
She was completely in love with him.

31
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,160
She.. she was in awe of him almost,

32
00:01:27,512 --> 00:01:30,454
and he turned into this
almost semi abusive drunk.

33
00:01:30,473 --> 00:01:32,769
Sometimes I don't know
what holds it together.

34
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,557
Our marriage.

35
00:01:35,788 --> 00:01:40,411
This unhappy couple have three
golden haired children to their name

36
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,839
but Cersei keeps a
deadly secret from Robert.

37
00:01:43,877 --> 00:01:46,506
The children are not his.

38
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:49,818
The truth will be discovered
on a royal trip north

39
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,054
and it's here that our
story really begins.

40
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:58,713
The King has asked his old
ally Ned Stark to help him rule.

41
00:01:59,877 --> 00:02:02,781
Ned and his wife
Catelyn govern the north.

42
00:02:02,806 --> 00:02:04,909
Fiercely loyal to the crown.

43
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:10,127
The Starks stand for
loyalty, integrity bravery.

44
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:12,545
They are really the
moral compass of the show.

45
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:14,553
They're the good guys
and they're the ones

46
00:02:14,579 --> 00:02:16,490
that you find yourself
rooting for from the start.

47
00:02:17,162 --> 00:02:19,144
The couple have five children:

48
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:21,036
three sons and two daughters

49
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:23,185
and the decimation of this happy family

50
00:02:23,223 --> 00:02:25,416
will reverberate throughout our tale.

51
00:02:26,548 --> 00:02:29,675
They're almost too
innocent for that world.

52
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:32,083
King Robert arrives
with his Queen Cersei

53
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:34,379
and with them is the
whole Lannister clan.

54
00:02:34,424 --> 00:02:36,955
That's Jamie Lannister.
The Queen's twin brother.

55
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:39,258
Oh, the Lannisters.

56
00:02:39,378 --> 00:02:42,608
They're blonde they're
beautiful they're arrogant,

57
00:02:43,146 --> 00:02:44,367
so fuck them.

58
00:02:44,392 --> 00:02:46,618
And it's really the Lannisters
who were going to introduce

59
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:49,640
a lot of trouble into the lives
of the Starks from this point.

60
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:52,529
The arrival of the
Lannisters into that world

61
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:56,344
totally sends shock waves
through the whole family.

62
00:02:58,084 --> 00:03:00,483
Bran Stark goes climbing one day,

63
00:03:00,603 --> 00:03:01,916
gets to the top of the tower

64
00:03:01,936 --> 00:03:05,139
and discovers the Lannister's
deepest, dark secret.

65
00:03:07,723 --> 00:03:09,865
The secret is that Cersei the queen

66
00:03:09,866 --> 00:03:12,014
is actually sleeping
with her brother Jaime.

67
00:03:12,134 --> 00:03:14,684
The Lannisters, oh god!

68
00:03:18,152 --> 00:03:19,493
They are..

69
00:03:19,918 --> 00:03:24,235
I have never seen a family.. I
mean talk about dysfunctional.

70
00:03:26,282 --> 00:03:28,016
Stop! Stop.

71
00:03:28,072 --> 00:03:31,259
It's incest which even in
Westeros is generally frowned upon.

72
00:03:31,274 --> 00:03:33,161
It also means that
King Robert's children

73
00:03:33,178 --> 00:03:34,685
are not actually his children.

74
00:03:34,696 --> 00:03:36,778
- It's alright, it's alright.
- He saw us!

75
00:03:36,898 --> 00:03:38,462
I heard you the first time.

76
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:40,806
He knows what it means
too, and he knows that

77
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:43,487
if the incest is
discovered, not only will

78
00:03:43,532 --> 00:03:44,948
he and his sister be put to death

79
00:03:44,968 --> 00:03:47,841
but their three children
may very well too.

80
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,752
And so for Jaime Lannister,

81
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:51,840
the greatest swordsman in Westeros,

82
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:53,583
there's only one solution.

83
00:03:53,828 --> 00:03:55,113
The things I do for love.

84
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,820
Here's a convenient way.

85
00:03:59,017 --> 00:04:00,343
The kid'll die,

86
00:04:00,463 --> 00:04:01,758
it'll look like he fell

87
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:03,653
and our kids will be safe.

88
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:05,364
First in a coma,

89
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:08,715
Bran will later awake with
no memory of how he fell

90
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,172
or what he saw.

91
00:04:10,487 --> 00:04:12,389
The Royal secret is safe for now

92
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,970
and only the viewer has seen what
the Lannisters will do to keep it.

93
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,197
Everything went pear
shaped after that and really

94
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:23,525
that's the whole chain
of events starting.

95
00:04:24,302 --> 00:04:26,788
King Robert still wants
Ned down in the capital,

96
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:28,303
so this will be the last ever time

97
00:04:28,328 --> 00:04:30,564
we see the Stark family all together.

98
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:33,367
A family which includes
Ned's son out of wedlock,

99
00:04:33,392 --> 00:04:35,397
the bastard Jon Snow.

100
00:04:35,602 --> 00:04:37,296
Ned must now leave his family

101
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:38,850
and follow King Robert south

102
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:41,628
taking his daughters
Sansa and Arya with him.

103
00:04:41,705 --> 00:04:44,492
The reason I think that the first
season of Game of Thrones works,

104
00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:46,587
is it's essentially
about this good family

105
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:49,330
that just wants to
essentially be left alone

106
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,113
and serve their king and their country.

107
00:04:52,154 --> 00:04:53,611
This good family is ripped apart

108
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,776
and thrown into situations
that they never anticipated.

109
00:04:56,455 --> 00:04:58,972
They are bound for the
capital, King's Landing

110
00:04:58,997 --> 00:05:01,427
where Ned's new task will
be to protect King Robert

111
00:05:01,591 --> 00:05:03,252
from those who would unseat him.

112
00:05:04,558 --> 00:05:05,897
And in season one,

113
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:09,388
viewers learned the greatest
enemies live in exile overseas.

114
00:05:09,465 --> 00:05:10,967
The Targaryens.

115
00:05:10,968 --> 00:05:14,082
They were dethroned by
King Robert in the last war.

116
00:05:14,303 --> 00:05:16,197
The only surviving members of the family

117
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:18,955
are a brother and sister
called Viserys and Daenerys.

118
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:23,502
The siblings are the children of
the Mad King who was killed in war.

119
00:05:24,497 --> 00:05:26,984
Viserys dominates his younger sister.

120
00:05:27,185 --> 00:05:30,553
Viserys has more than a
touch of the Targaryen madness

121
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,677
and you know sometimes
he's protecting her

122
00:05:32,698 --> 00:05:34,866
but he's also trying to treat her as a,

123
00:05:34,986 --> 00:05:37,443
- as a bargaining chip.
- Come forward my dear.

124
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,717
In search of an army,

125
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:42,351
Viserys makes a pact with a
savage tribe, the Dothraki.

126
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:44,074
Offering his beautiful young sister

127
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:46,460
in marriage to their leader, Khal Drogo.

128
00:05:46,505 --> 00:05:48,175
She's the only bargaining chip he has;

129
00:05:48,187 --> 00:05:51,473
he doesn't have any wealth
anymore; he doesn't have any armies,

130
00:05:51,526 --> 00:05:54,861
but he has her who he can
trade to this horse lord.

131
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:58,315
I would let his whole tribe fuck you,

132
00:05:58,737 --> 00:06:01,932
all 40,000 men, and their horses too,

133
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:03,353
if that's what it took.

134
00:06:04,936 --> 00:06:07,834
He's power-hungry but to a nasty degree.

135
00:06:08,071 --> 00:06:10,355
He doesn't really care
how or by what means,

136
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:14,268
he just wants to be
important and looked up to.

137
00:06:14,534 --> 00:06:16,368
But his plans backfire.

138
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:18,888
Daenerys and Khal Drogo fall in love

139
00:06:18,974 --> 00:06:21,213
and become quite the power couple.

140
00:06:21,577 --> 00:06:25,052
Suddenly she finds herself
with Khal Drogo empowered.

141
00:06:25,172 --> 00:06:26,627
People are obeying her.

142
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:29,394
Tell him I want what was bargained
for or I'm taking you back.

143
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:34,594
He completely underestimates
not only Danny but Khal Drogo.

144
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,421
What's he saying?

145
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:39,445
He says yes.

146
00:06:41,063 --> 00:06:42,226
You shall have

147
00:06:42,766 --> 00:06:44,207
a golden crown.

148
00:06:45,095 --> 00:06:47,858
It's a real coming-of-age story
throughout the first season.

149
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:50,072
She really grows into herself.

150
00:06:54,325 --> 00:06:56,044
- Look away Khaleesi.
- No.

151
00:06:56,164 --> 00:06:58,524
This is one of the turning
points for Daenerys.

152
00:06:58,549 --> 00:07:00,603
I think this is when you realize that

153
00:07:00,677 --> 00:07:04,590
she's prepared to sacrifice
anything for the greater good.

154
00:07:04,623 --> 00:07:06,374
Crown for king.

155
00:07:16,446 --> 00:07:17,812
He was revolting.

156
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,780
He was utterly, utterly revolting,

157
00:07:21,821 --> 00:07:23,978
and that was the moment that she escaped

158
00:07:24,098 --> 00:07:27,575
from her shell. When
she became the woman

159
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:29,236
and not the kowtowed girl.

160
00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:31,847
And as the Targaryens grow in power,

161
00:07:31,888 --> 00:07:34,307
we learn that King Robert
faces another challenge

162
00:07:34,322 --> 00:07:36,205
to his northernmost borders.

163
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:38,041
Threats which led past rulers

164
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:41,587
to build this giant wall of ice
to keep out wild things beyond.

165
00:07:41,707 --> 00:07:44,351
It's protected by the
legendary Night's Watch.

166
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,231
The Night's Watch are a small army

167
00:07:47,251 --> 00:07:49,783
who guard the northern
border of the country.

168
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:52,949
In season one, there's lots
of fighting for the throne

169
00:07:52,964 --> 00:07:55,112
but actually in the background
there are these creatures

170
00:07:55,116 --> 00:07:56,984
appearing north of the Wall

171
00:07:58,112 --> 00:08:00,469
that nobody has seen
for thousands of years

172
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,233
and no one quite wants to believe

173
00:08:02,254 --> 00:08:03,932
that they're there
but they certainly are.

174
00:08:04,546 --> 00:08:08,270
We hear the characters saying
that this is all folklore

175
00:08:08,315 --> 00:08:09,604
or that this is all made up,

176
00:08:09,633 --> 00:08:12,882
but for the viewer we see that basically

177
00:08:12,895 --> 00:08:15,682
these characters do
exist. They are there.

178
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:23,777
I think the White Walkers
are really terrifying

179
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,582
mostly because you're not 100% sure,

180
00:08:25,607 --> 00:08:27,256
you know what they're capable of doing

181
00:08:27,288 --> 00:08:28,769
or what their motives are.

182
00:08:29,763 --> 00:08:32,201
They are a serious threat.

183
00:08:32,737 --> 00:08:35,115
In season one, in search of a purpose,

184
00:08:35,143 --> 00:08:38,233
Jon Snow ventures to the Wall
and joins the Night's Watch,

185
00:08:38,274 --> 00:08:40,189
a leader in the making.

186
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,958
Jon Snow's everybody's hero,

187
00:08:43,962 --> 00:08:47,208
Jon Snow's one of my favorite
characters. He's the dude.

188
00:08:47,535 --> 00:08:50,003
He's also in search of answers.

189
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:51,263
The question of Jon...

190
00:08:51,271 --> 00:08:54,321
Jon Snow's parentage has
been one of the burning topics

191
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:58,102
amongst not only the show's fans
but book fans for many decades.

192
00:08:58,222 --> 00:09:01,081
Jon Snow is Ned Stark's bastard son.

193
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,579
He brought him back from a war

194
00:09:02,595 --> 00:09:04,533
and we never really
learned who the mother is.

195
00:09:04,574 --> 00:09:07,955
Understandably Catelyn, Ned's wife,

196
00:09:07,976 --> 00:09:10,140
isn't too fond of Jon for that reason.

197
00:09:10,202 --> 00:09:16,070
Try as she may she could
never make peace with that,

198
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:18,362
with the fact that Ned was, unfaithful.

199
00:09:18,898 --> 00:09:21,195
But down in the capital King's Landing,

200
00:09:21,221 --> 00:09:24,173
Ned Stark has a much
greater challenge to face.

201
00:09:24,178 --> 00:09:26,884
His daughter has fallen
for Prince Joffrey.

202
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,751
She's presented with
marrying the future king,

203
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,212
live in a beautiful
castle, go to banquets,

204
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:34,175
have beautiful dresses to
wear. A fairy tale story.

205
00:09:34,295 --> 00:09:37,378
Ned has discovered the Queen
and her brother are lovers

206
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:39,929
and this will be his family's undoing.

207
00:09:40,978 --> 00:09:44,011
When the King returns from his
hunt I'll tell him the truth.

208
00:09:44,022 --> 00:09:45,219
You must be gone by then,

209
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:46,999
you and your children.

210
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:49,056
I will not have their blood on my hands.

211
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:51,007
But before he gets the
chance to talk to King Robert,

212
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:53,100
King Robert gets himself
killed on a hunting trip.

213
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:56,289
Joffrey is now king, and
without Robert to protect him

214
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:57,916
Ned is tried for treason.

215
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,447
He confesses, believing
it will save his daughter,

216
00:10:00,478 --> 00:10:02,212
but misjudges the new ruler.

217
00:10:02,332 --> 00:10:04,801
He's been stuck up in the north too long

218
00:10:04,817 --> 00:10:07,948
and has no idea how
the real world operates,

219
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,110
how to really deal with the kind of...

220
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,866
the politics of Westeros.

221
00:10:13,217 --> 00:10:14,663
Bring me his head!

222
00:10:18,206 --> 00:10:22,139
That's when you realize nobody
is safe in this world at all.

223
00:10:25,464 --> 00:10:28,892
When I saw Sean Bean pushed down

224
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,187
that was the only scene that
really has brought a tear to my eye.

225
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:39,865
It's cruel, it's heartbreaking,

226
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:43,095
but there's a point to the
children witnessing this.

227
00:10:43,735 --> 00:10:47,910
If they want to survive they
have to start to be resilient.

228
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,470
They have to learn from this.

229
00:10:49,521 --> 00:10:51,081
It was at that moment you realize

230
00:10:51,094 --> 00:10:53,051
what Game of Thrones was really about.

231
00:10:53,294 --> 00:10:55,846
It's here that the
Stark family splinters.

232
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:59,132
Arya is whisked away by a Night's
Watch brother loyal to Ned,

233
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,907
leaving Sansa at the mercy of Joffrey.

234
00:11:03,148 --> 00:11:05,635
Robb Stark reacts with murderous rage

235
00:11:05,654 --> 00:11:08,109
to the news that his
father has been beheaded.

236
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:11,773
Robb's the heir and he's not only
picking up his father's mantle

237
00:11:11,893 --> 00:11:13,454
as Lord of Winterfell,

238
00:11:13,574 --> 00:11:15,634
but he's picking up a much older mantle.

239
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:18,991
The crown that no one
has worn for 300 years,

240
00:11:19,017 --> 00:11:20,871
the kingdom of the north.

241
00:11:20,991 --> 00:11:24,611
It will lead to all-out war between
the Starks and the Lannisters

242
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,892
who were led by its
patriarch Tywin Lannister.

243
00:11:28,243 --> 00:11:31,658
Tywin Lannister is one
of the great warriors

244
00:11:31,856 --> 00:11:35,067
and battle strategists of the age.

245
00:11:35,187 --> 00:11:37,624
As well as his twins, Cersei and Jaime,

246
00:11:37,643 --> 00:11:41,761
he has a son he despises,
Tyrion, known as the Imp.

247
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:43,430
You're wounded.

248
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:49,114
- Good of you to notice.
- Tyrion obviously is just brilliant.

249
00:11:49,146 --> 00:11:51,742
- I hear we won.
- Stereotypes of what

250
00:11:51,862 --> 00:11:54,243
a hero should be or should
look like in Game of Thrones

251
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,984
are just completely
blown out the window,

252
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,907
because we've got Tyrion who, you know,

253
00:11:57,922 --> 00:12:00,793
doesn't look like your
archetypal hero, but he is.

254
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:02,768
As war rages in Westeros,

255
00:12:02,803 --> 00:12:05,715
over the Narrow Sea,
Daenerys loses a husband

256
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:08,252
but gains astonishing new powers.

257
00:12:08,298 --> 00:12:10,984
She walks into Khal Drogo's funeral pyre

258
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,825
with fossilized dragon's eggs.

259
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:15,224
What an epic scene.

260
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:23,092
Season one ends with
the sight of Daenerys

261
00:12:23,128 --> 00:12:27,446
emerging from a fire, unscathed
with her dragons hatched.

262
00:12:28,275 --> 00:12:30,945
These creatures are
extraordinary creatures

263
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,035
the likes of which have not
been seen in hundreds of years.

264
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,616
'Blood of my blood..'

265
00:12:35,736 --> 00:12:38,835
You see these, these three dragons
around her and you're, just, like,

266
00:12:38,955 --> 00:12:41,157
they're gonna be awesome
when they're grown.

267
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,756
The innocence is gone, she's it.

268
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:47,837
She's the force now.

269
00:12:47,957 --> 00:12:51,249
As the dragons are born she
comes more and more into her own

270
00:12:51,305 --> 00:12:55,280
- until the power becomes innate to her.
- It's about a new era.

271
00:12:55,648 --> 00:12:57,663
The whole first season is essentially

272
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,732
the old era dying out;
the new era beginning

273
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,587
and by the end she has a sense that

274
00:13:03,602 --> 00:13:06,360
she knows that she's
bound for greatness.

275
00:13:07,194 --> 00:13:11,404
And after the break, watch
those dragons grow in season two.

276
00:13:16,402 --> 00:13:19,496
Welcome back to Game of
Thrones: The Story So Far,

277
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,998
where season two marks
a new reign of tyranny

278
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:24,029
in the capital, King's Landing.

279
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,224
Joffrey is brutalizing his subjects

280
00:13:26,229 --> 00:13:28,810
as well as his bride-to-be Sansa Stark.

281
00:13:28,853 --> 00:13:30,024
You can't!

282
00:13:30,828 --> 00:13:31,764
What did you say?

283
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,992
Sansa has learned some
painful lessons along the way.

284
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,734
The chivalrous knights
and gallant princes

285
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,149
that she dreamed of, she..
she got a gallant prince

286
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,653
and he turned out to be Joffrey.

287
00:13:41,812 --> 00:13:44,749
Killing you would send
your brother a message.

288
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:49,441
She's a prisoner in the
worst place imaginable,

289
00:13:49,476 --> 00:13:51,758
enduring all kinds of psychological and

290
00:13:51,788 --> 00:13:54,157
sometimes physical
abuse from these captors.

291
00:13:54,277 --> 00:13:55,405
Leave her face.

292
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:57,810
I like her pretty.

293
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,232
He's a bully,

294
00:14:03,437 --> 00:14:05,959
and we don't like bullies.

295
00:14:06,527 --> 00:14:08,665
I heard a disgusting
lie about Uncle Jaime.

296
00:14:09,995 --> 00:14:11,116
And you.

297
00:14:11,157 --> 00:14:13,541
He's the product of a
brother and sister shagging,

298
00:14:13,567 --> 00:14:17,639
so like you know this might be
why he isn't all there mentally.

299
00:14:19,051 --> 00:14:22,177
Cersei's smart enough to
realize that Joffrey is

300
00:14:22,755 --> 00:14:26,755
perhaps not what she
might have hoped for

301
00:14:26,872 --> 00:14:28,759
and he's getting out of her control now

302
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,332
and he's a danger in part even to her

303
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,149
and even to other members of the family.

304
00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:34,981
What you just did,

305
00:14:35,795 --> 00:14:37,304
is punishable by death.

306
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,398
Joffrey's enemies are everywhere.

307
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,340
Chief amongst them and just
across the bay at Dragonstone

308
00:14:45,355 --> 00:14:48,036
is Stannis, brother of
the late King Robert,

309
00:14:48,093 --> 00:14:50,390
who believes the throne should be his.

310
00:14:52,283 --> 00:14:55,669
Stannis has learned that Robert's
children are Lannister bastards

311
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:58,467
which means that it is
Stannis who is next in line.

312
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:01,004
So Stannis Baratheon, who knows that

313
00:15:01,045 --> 00:15:03,014
King Joffrey is the product of incest,

314
00:15:03,134 --> 00:15:06,222
decides to send ravens out to all
the corners of the Seven Kingdoms

315
00:15:06,243 --> 00:15:08,458
letting them know the Lannister secret.

316
00:15:08,626 --> 00:15:10,304
In order to claim the throne,

317
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,144
Stannis enlists the red
priestess, Melisandre,

318
00:15:13,264 --> 00:15:17,020
who was on her own mission to
find the right ruler for Westeros.

319
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:21,165
She believes Stannis is the
savior of the world, basically.

320
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:22,816
He's supposed to be on the Iron Throne

321
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:26,581
and her magical powers
have no limits, I think.

322
00:15:26,622 --> 00:15:29,839
There's there's so much that
we don't know that she can do.

323
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,974
However, Stannis isn't the
only one after the throne.

324
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,721
His younger brother, Renly
also believes he has a claim

325
00:15:35,762 --> 00:15:37,501
and so war is inevitable.

326
00:15:37,568 --> 00:15:40,484
The Iron Throne is mine by right.

327
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,553
All those that deny that are my foes.

328
00:15:44,868 --> 00:15:47,089
The whole realm denies
it, from Dorne to the Wall.

329
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,746
They both think they should be king

330
00:15:48,931 --> 00:15:52,276
but I'm on Stannis'
side, so screw Renly.

331
00:15:52,306 --> 00:15:54,041
Rather than fight it
out on the battlefield,

332
00:15:54,051 --> 00:15:56,384
Stannis finds another
way to kill his brother.

333
00:15:56,504 --> 00:15:59,383
I guess family ties don't
mean an awful lot in Westeros.

334
00:15:59,403 --> 00:16:02,303
The powerful sorcery of the
red priestess is revealed

335
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,640
when she gives birth
to a sinister weapon.

336
00:16:08,037 --> 00:16:12,544
The shadow baby is basically
just a way to kill Renly

337
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,146
and it comes out of me in a great way.

338
00:16:18,825 --> 00:16:23,423
I think Melisandre, she's
always lived by this religion.

339
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,294
If she's got something
to do she's gonna do it

340
00:16:27,315 --> 00:16:29,452
and she's not gonna let
other people stand in her way.

341
00:16:29,497 --> 00:16:31,016
What I think's brilliant
about Game of Thrones,

342
00:16:31,028 --> 00:16:33,344
he lives in a fantasy world,
it's a completely realistic

343
00:16:33,365 --> 00:16:35,165
depiction of how power works.

344
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:38,054
What power does to people,
what people do to get power

345
00:16:38,107 --> 00:16:39,519
and what happens when they fall short,

346
00:16:39,527 --> 00:16:40,579
when they miss the mark.

347
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:41,967
That's why it's so brilliant.

348
00:16:46,162 --> 00:16:50,497
When Renly is murdered, he leaves
behind his widow, Margaery Tyrell

349
00:16:50,866 --> 00:16:52,888
who belongs to the Tyrell family

350
00:16:52,896 --> 00:16:54,963
who are very rich and
powerful in their own right.

351
00:16:55,532 --> 00:16:57,713
Calling yourself king
doesn't make you one

352
00:16:57,746 --> 00:17:00,446
and if Renly wasn't a
king I wasn't a queen.

353
00:17:01,142 --> 00:17:04,810
Margaery is an absolute piece of work.

354
00:17:05,472 --> 00:17:09,286
You know she wants power.

355
00:17:09,842 --> 00:17:11,261
Do you want to be a queen?

356
00:17:11,462 --> 00:17:12,289
No.

357
00:17:14,989 --> 00:17:16,585
I want to be <i>the</i> queen.

358
00:17:18,262 --> 00:17:19,847
Across the Narrow Sea,

359
00:17:19,876 --> 00:17:22,769
Daenerys Targaryen is
learning valuable lessons

360
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:26,473
in her quest to return to
Westeros and seize the throne.

361
00:17:26,501 --> 00:17:29,325
She's desperate to be a good ruler.

362
00:17:29,445 --> 00:17:32,267
That she can, you know,
go to bed at night saying

363
00:17:32,328 --> 00:17:34,653
I think I'm doing things the right way.

364
00:17:34,817 --> 00:17:37,894
As Daenerys' power
grows, so do her dragons

365
00:17:37,915 --> 00:17:39,990
but as news of their existence spreads,

366
00:17:40,035 --> 00:17:42,163
they become highly sought after.

367
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:43,220
When she's in Qarth,

368
00:17:43,408 --> 00:17:45,487
everybody's kind of think "Who are you?

369
00:17:45,503 --> 00:17:46,899
We'll just take your dragons.

370
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,147
We'll take your dragons and
you're not powerful anymore."

371
00:17:53,303 --> 00:17:55,056
Dracarys!

372
00:17:56,955 --> 00:17:59,769
People have underestimated
her, the whole way.

373
00:18:01,304 --> 00:18:02,769
And it is in season two,

374
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:06,517
that we finally see the
dragons kill for Daenerys.

375
00:18:10,776 --> 00:18:13,014
As Daenerys gets stronger in exile,

376
00:18:13,027 --> 00:18:16,236
Jon Snow and the Night's Watch
are on a mission beyond the Wall

377
00:18:16,301 --> 00:18:19,733
where the true scale of the
threat to the kingdom is revealed.

378
00:18:19,938 --> 00:18:22,286
... Blown the horn. When will he come?

379
00:18:22,337 --> 00:18:24,603
The army of the dead is on its way

380
00:18:24,864 --> 00:18:26,977
and it's gonna kick off sooner or later

381
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:29,212
and really you know they've
got to get out of there

382
00:18:29,222 --> 00:18:31,632
- as fast as they possibly can.
- One blast for friends,

383
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:34,471
two for foes.

384
00:18:36,769 --> 00:18:38,650
And three for White Walkers.

385
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:41,357
The threat of winter
coming is very much a myth

386
00:18:41,477 --> 00:18:42,805
to the people of the south.

387
00:18:42,925 --> 00:18:44,524
They're not really taking it seriously.

388
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:47,066
They don't know about the undead and

389
00:18:47,424 --> 00:18:50,378
all the horrors that
are coming towards them.

390
00:18:55,949 --> 00:18:57,770
So what we learn in season two

391
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,859
is that the White Walkers
are very much real.

392
00:19:01,217 --> 00:19:03,816
They're nothing like we've
ever seen before in television.

393
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,962
They're not just zombies, they're
not just statues, they're walking...

394
00:19:06,973 --> 00:19:09,223
ice cubes, basically.

395
00:19:09,423 --> 00:19:11,714
They're, they're really bad
and they're, really scary

396
00:19:12,257 --> 00:19:15,575
and it's literally, I think it's
got to be a fight of Ice and Fire.

397
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,182
We have all these kingdoms
wanting to fight for the throne

398
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:28,837
and they think that that is what
ultimately the battle is about

399
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:32,181
but really at the end of
the day, they're not looking

400
00:19:32,301 --> 00:19:35,763
at what's the real problem
here and it's the White Walkers.

401
00:19:39,434 --> 00:19:42,153
And it's in season
two in King's Landing,

402
00:19:42,178 --> 00:19:45,370
where we see that Tyrion may
just be an asset to the war

403
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:48,681
when Stannis launches
an attack on the city.

404
00:19:50,124 --> 00:19:51,812
I'll lead the attack!

405
00:19:52,032 --> 00:19:54,564
Battle of Blackwater was his moment.

406
00:19:54,654 --> 00:19:58,432
He was the best person to speak
to the people of King's Landing

407
00:19:58,451 --> 00:20:02,230
and to get them to protect
their, their.. their.. their city

408
00:20:02,454 --> 00:20:05,006
because he knows what
it's like to fight,

409
00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:07,811
he knows what it's like to have
your back up against the wall.

410
00:20:08,287 --> 00:20:10,845
Those are brave men
knocking at our door.

411
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,756
Let's go kill them!

412
00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:20,146
Tyrion manages to get
the troops fired up

413
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,269
by giving a good speech and

414
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,896
fired up then heads out with
them to fight Stannis on the bay.

415
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,236
He doesn't last very long,

416
00:20:27,262 --> 00:20:29,104
he gets knocked out
after a couple of minutes.

417
00:20:29,263 --> 00:20:32,239
Tyrion is upstaged by his father Tywin

418
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:36,040
who arrives with his own massive
army bolstered by the Tyrells

419
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,422
who've now firmly joined the cause.

420
00:20:39,089 --> 00:20:41,418
It's that moment where you really see

421
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,169
where power lies.

422
00:20:43,324 --> 00:20:44,712
It's not in the king,

423
00:20:44,986 --> 00:20:46,815
it's in the person behind the king.

424
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,545
The battle is over.

425
00:20:50,335 --> 00:20:51,493
We have won!

426
00:20:51,546 --> 00:20:55,167
And so season 2 ends with
the Lannisters victorious.

427
00:20:55,347 --> 00:20:59,713
After the break, season 3 brings
more terrible losses for the Starks

428
00:20:59,754 --> 00:21:02,634
when they attend a cataclysmic wedding.

429
00:21:07,812 --> 00:21:09,805
Welcome back to The Story So Far.

430
00:21:10,218 --> 00:21:11,995
Where as season three begins,

431
00:21:12,044 --> 00:21:14,259
Daenerys has set sail on a mission.

432
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:17,741
She and her dragons may have
grown in power and stature

433
00:21:17,802 --> 00:21:19,959
but securing an army still eludes her.

434
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,869
So she ventures to a place
where she can buy one.

435
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,027
She knows she needs an
army, a powerful army too,

436
00:21:29,052 --> 00:21:32,059
if she ever wants to
reclaim the Westerosi throne

437
00:21:32,092 --> 00:21:35,030
and the best bet for
that are the Unsullied.

438
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:36,258
I have dragons.

439
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,494
- I'll give you one.
- She appears to want to trade

440
00:21:39,523 --> 00:21:41,435
the dragon for slaves.

441
00:21:41,443 --> 00:21:44,291
She seems to have made
this daft agreement

442
00:21:44,315 --> 00:21:46,386
to give away her best dragon.

443
00:21:49,247 --> 00:21:50,376
She hands over the dragon.

444
00:21:50,388 --> 00:21:53,230
Next thing you know once she's
got control of the Unsullied...

445
00:21:53,251 --> 00:21:56,203
_

446
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,733
Then it's very easy to say to the dragon

447
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:01,939
who still will listen
to her and not to him,

448
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,384
- burn him.
- Dracarys!

449
00:22:08,628 --> 00:22:12,337
Because you would take power if
you have the force of a dragon.

450
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:14,655
They're pretty impressive creatures.

451
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:16,353
She's been the mother of dragons

452
00:22:16,363 --> 00:22:17,785
and knew she was destined for greatness

453
00:22:17,806 --> 00:22:19,797
but now she really is
a queen with an army.

454
00:22:19,858 --> 00:22:23,527
To then see that she
has thousands of people

455
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:29,655
on her team and then you
get like this swoop past.

456
00:22:29,707 --> 00:22:33,599
She's got these, like
fire-breathing mythical creatures

457
00:22:33,615 --> 00:22:36,106
that are just gonna tear shit up.

458
00:22:36,884 --> 00:22:39,369
As this young Targaryen gains followers,

459
00:22:39,431 --> 00:22:42,672
in King's Landing a young
Tyrell is gaining influence.

460
00:22:42,682 --> 00:22:45,844
Margaery has replaced Sansa
in Joffrey's affections,

461
00:22:45,869 --> 00:22:49,214
a reward for her family's
military support at Blackwater.

462
00:22:51,849 --> 00:22:55,616
I imagine it must be so exciting
to squeeze your finger here and

463
00:22:56,076 --> 00:22:58,346
watch something die over there.

464
00:22:59,076 --> 00:23:01,787
Marjorie is a woman
who's on top of the game,

465
00:23:01,808 --> 00:23:03,578
she's controlling where she's going,

466
00:23:03,698 --> 00:23:06,182
she's a proper feminist icon.

467
00:23:06,244 --> 00:23:07,711
But the Tyrell's ambitions

468
00:23:07,717 --> 00:23:10,500
are not going down well
with Cersei Lannister.

469
00:23:10,535 --> 00:23:12,628
Alana is a matriarch of the family

470
00:23:12,653 --> 00:23:14,945
and she advises her granddaughter

471
00:23:14,997 --> 00:23:17,099
on how best to play the political game

472
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:19,450
so that she might take
power in King's Landing.

473
00:23:19,851 --> 00:23:21,570
To make matters worse,

474
00:23:21,646 --> 00:23:24,251
her soul mate Jaime
is a prisoner of war.

475
00:23:24,266 --> 00:23:26,205
He is held first by Brienne of Tarth,

476
00:23:26,282 --> 00:23:28,922
then both are captured
by a northern faction.

477
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:31,592
Looks like your woman's
getting the better of you.

478
00:23:31,712 --> 00:23:33,085
This is all bundled up in

479
00:23:33,101 --> 00:23:35,838
when Jaime begins to start
thinking about other people.

480
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,508
His efforts to stop Brienne being raped

481
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:42,789
are the beginning of that.

482
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,106
You know who she is, don't you?

483
00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:47,250
It's good when those little

484
00:23:47,306 --> 00:23:50,126
bits of goodness come in those
characters that are so devilish,

485
00:23:50,169 --> 00:23:52,463
as well just give you
a little light in there.

486
00:23:52,627 --> 00:23:56,076
Lord Selwyn would pay his
daughter's weight  in sapphires

487
00:23:56,077 --> 00:23:57,099
if she's returned to him.

488
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,075
I mean of course it being Game of
Thrones it doesn't get him anywhere.

489
00:24:03,952 --> 00:24:05,712
Another one of those
Game of Thrones moments

490
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:07,404
which has so much more going on in it

491
00:24:07,427 --> 00:24:09,322
than just him losing his hand.

492
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:12,419
He's the greatest swordsman
in Westeros we're told,

493
00:24:12,431 --> 00:24:13,692
so he can't do that anymore.

494
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:15,452
He's now made a good friend in her

495
00:24:15,464 --> 00:24:17,523
and he's seen a lot of things and

496
00:24:18,014 --> 00:24:21,901
I'm sure he's questioning what
being a Lannister is about as well.

497
00:24:22,204 --> 00:24:23,342
Yet without his hand,

498
00:24:23,383 --> 00:24:26,154
we see Jaime Lannister
at his most heroic.

499
00:24:26,274 --> 00:24:29,072
The heartless knight who
pushed Bran Stark from the tower

500
00:24:29,146 --> 00:24:31,270
finds new honor in Season 3.

501
00:24:31,646 --> 00:24:33,656
He's left, he's left her behind,

502
00:24:33,742 --> 00:24:35,002
he's abandoned her

503
00:24:35,122 --> 00:24:37,880
and he's on his way to
King's Landing and then,

504
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:40,824
then his captors mentioned that,

505
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,522
what's gonna happen to her.

506
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:43,500
Nice bear!

507
00:24:43,521 --> 00:24:45,636
And then he decides
to return and save her.

508
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:52,344
And it is in season three that
we witness the fearsome work

509
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:55,384
of another powerful
family, the Bolton's,

510
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,594
who are scheming to take
control of the north.

511
00:24:57,623 --> 00:25:00,541
I think the Bolton's want pretty
much what everyone else seems to want.

512
00:25:00,562 --> 00:25:03,223
It's power and status.

513
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,691
Kill me!

514
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:08,865
You're no good to me dead.

515
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,471
We need you.

516
00:25:10,486 --> 00:25:12,758
Ramsay, a bastard son of the family,

517
00:25:12,788 --> 00:25:14,653
enjoys torturing his enemies

518
00:25:14,656 --> 00:25:16,442
including Theon Greyjoy

519
00:25:16,477 --> 00:25:20,119
who he took prisoner when sacking
Winterfell after Ned's demise.

520
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:22,697
Historically, the Bolton's
have always been just...

521
00:25:23,114 --> 00:25:24,891
just under the Starks,
kind of the Starks

522
00:25:24,895 --> 00:25:26,433
have always been on
top of them, so I think

523
00:25:26,854 --> 00:25:29,769
they feel that now
is their time to rise.

524
00:25:30,698 --> 00:25:34,001
You don't look like a
Theon Greyjoy anymore.

525
00:25:34,238 --> 00:25:38,027
It's unbelievable what Ramsay
is capable of doing to people.

526
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:38,952
Reek!

527
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,738
He's just all about the mind,

528
00:25:40,858 --> 00:25:42,821
he's all about making
you doubt yourself,

529
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:45,392
he's all about getting in
there and making you insecure

530
00:25:45,404 --> 00:25:46,787
and making you feel like you

531
00:25:47,057 --> 00:25:48,911
can't go up against him.

532
00:25:48,948 --> 00:25:51,105
Another hostage at large in season three

533
00:25:51,117 --> 00:25:54,055
is Arya Stark, kidnapped by the Hound.

534
00:25:54,175 --> 00:25:57,005
The disgraced knight
plans to find Arya's family

535
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,740
and trade her for cash.

536
00:25:59,301 --> 00:26:01,601
Remember what happens
to children who run.

537
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,999
One of the great double
acts of Game of Thrones

538
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,075
is the Hound and Arya.

539
00:26:08,805 --> 00:26:09,742
Don't!

540
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,590
- Don't kill him.
- There's something so

541
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:15,971
perversely magical about that pairing,

542
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:20,145
sort of warped mentor-protégé
relationship that develops.

543
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:29,512
In his desire to claim a ransom,

544
00:26:29,574 --> 00:26:31,534
the Hound heads for the Twins

545
00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:33,610
where he knows Arya's
mother and brother,

546
00:26:33,655 --> 00:26:35,079
Catelyn and Robb Stark,

547
00:26:35,153 --> 00:26:36,716
are attending a wedding.

548
00:26:37,072 --> 00:26:39,425
The Twins is a strategic river crossing

549
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:40,882
controlled by the Frey family

550
00:26:41,002 --> 00:26:43,669
and the Starks need them
onside for their war effort.

551
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:47,620
Walder Frey is a very
bitter nasty old man

552
00:26:47,631 --> 00:26:50,508
who controls a small but
significant area in the kingdom.

553
00:26:50,628 --> 00:26:53,451
I was pledged to marry one
of you and I broke that vow.

554
00:26:53,758 --> 00:26:56,827
If he's been let down by Robb Stark

555
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,598
after this promise,

556
00:26:58,802 --> 00:27:01,961
if he shows any kind of forgiveness

557
00:27:01,973 --> 00:27:04,629
or, just let it go, we didn't
want to marry my daughters,

558
00:27:04,641 --> 00:27:08,443
marry someone else, he would lose face,

559
00:27:08,934 --> 00:27:12,019
in that world, it's a vicious
world he's operating in.

560
00:27:12,139 --> 00:27:15,407
The Stark family offer
Robb's uncle to make amends

561
00:27:15,476 --> 00:27:17,297
and are here for that wedding,

562
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:18,861
a terrible mistake.

563
00:27:19,241 --> 00:27:21,124
Catelyn in her heart

564
00:27:21,636 --> 00:27:25,330
knew that you do not break a promise
if you are the king of the north

565
00:27:25,342 --> 00:27:27,511
and also you certainly don't
break it to Walder Frey.

566
00:27:27,528 --> 00:27:28,427
Your grace...

567
00:27:28,448 --> 00:27:30,432
He's probably laid awake for nights

568
00:27:30,469 --> 00:27:32,679
just planning it and
timing it and working out

569
00:27:32,703 --> 00:27:34,029
just how it's gonna work out.

570
00:27:34,037 --> 00:27:36,545
The moment when Cat sees that

571
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,755
Roose Bolton is wearing chainmail

572
00:27:39,287 --> 00:27:41,157
is a powerful moment.

573
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,226
Why would you wear
chain mail to a wedding,

574
00:27:44,591 --> 00:27:46,335
and what is the purpose of chain mail,

575
00:27:46,343 --> 00:27:47,943
it's to prevent you getting killed.

576
00:27:49,699 --> 00:27:51,939
- Robb!
- Even though I'd read the scripts,

577
00:27:51,966 --> 00:27:54,029
the Red Wedding still completely,

578
00:27:54,185 --> 00:27:57,450
was shocking and I was
still screaming at the TV,

579
00:27:57,466 --> 00:28:00,195
"Don't do it, no don't, don't",
you just don't want it to happen.

580
00:28:00,277 --> 00:28:02,052
The Red Wedding is the event that

581
00:28:02,067 --> 00:28:05,464
pretty much decimates an entire
generation of the Stark family.

582
00:28:06,354 --> 00:28:08,109
Within the Game of Thrones,

583
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,761
Walder Frey's not playing
the Game of Thrones.

584
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,804
He's not attempting to be the king.

585
00:28:11,831 --> 00:28:14,341
He's actually perfectly
happy with what he's got.

586
00:28:14,557 --> 00:28:16,639
He has his own little fiefdom

587
00:28:16,921 --> 00:28:19,386
and he's all sitting in the
chair watching terrible things.

588
00:28:21,328 --> 00:28:23,472
He's a rotter isn't he.

589
00:28:23,753 --> 00:28:26,150
He's absolutely rotten.

590
00:28:26,781 --> 00:28:27,803
Grim.

591
00:28:27,996 --> 00:28:30,282
The Lannisters send their regards.

592
00:28:31,324 --> 00:28:33,902
It is an ambush backed
by Tywin Lannister.

593
00:28:36,142 --> 00:28:37,815
Robb was such an amazing character

594
00:28:37,844 --> 00:28:40,066
and you kind of want him to be the king

595
00:28:41,649 --> 00:28:42,652
and to win.

596
00:28:45,996 --> 00:28:47,747
It's the cruelty of it

597
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,453
and it's the relishing of it.

598
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:52,948
Everything goes to
hell at the Red Wedding.

599
00:28:55,473 --> 00:28:57,590
Arya stark arrives at the Twins

600
00:28:57,655 --> 00:28:59,845
to witness her brother's desecrated body

601
00:28:59,923 --> 00:29:02,694
and loses any last shred of innocence.

602
00:29:02,814 --> 00:29:05,957
She's there. She's there at
the Red Wedding, she's outside

603
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:07,877
and she was so close,

604
00:29:08,031 --> 00:29:11,157
you know she was so close to
seeing them again, she was so close.

605
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,715
The path that she goes on,

606
00:29:13,216 --> 00:29:16,004
she learns to become stronger and fight

607
00:29:16,063 --> 00:29:18,751
and also she is after revenge.

608
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:21,819
And when she comes across
her family's killers later...

609
00:29:21,891 --> 00:29:22,585
You little shit.

610
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,476
... she matches their brutality.

611
00:29:27,334 --> 00:29:30,722
She's had to go over to the dark side,

612
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:32,730
that's what makes her interesting.

613
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,508
In order to survive in that world,

614
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:36,733
you've got to match what is given you.

615
00:29:36,961 --> 00:29:39,278
And so by the end of season 3,

616
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,587
all the elder Starks have
gone from the Game of Thrones.

617
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,237
Only the children remain,

618
00:29:44,288 --> 00:29:46,827
orphaned and scattered across Westeros,

619
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:49,896
including Bran Stark, still
paralyzed from his fall.

620
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:53,571
He's fled Winterfell with a loyal
band of followers heading north.

621
00:29:53,602 --> 00:29:55,685
So Hodor we know as

622
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,884
- a very loyal character.
- It's all right, Hodor.

623
00:30:00,247 --> 00:30:02,846
He lost the use of his legs
and Hodor's the person that

624
00:30:02,966 --> 00:30:05,000
carries him around and
takes him everywhere.

625
00:30:05,431 --> 00:30:08,234
Being the big giant of a man that he is.

626
00:30:09,785 --> 00:30:10,864
It's all right.

627
00:30:11,468 --> 00:30:13,044
The wolves will protect him.

628
00:30:13,054 --> 00:30:15,591
Him and his brother
Rickon are the two last

629
00:30:15,711 --> 00:30:19,144
male heirs to, to the,
to the Stark household

630
00:30:19,503 --> 00:30:22,441
and yet it's fast depleting.

631
00:30:22,486 --> 00:30:24,739
We're running out of Starks.

632
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:27,229
Bran Stark is very
much on his own journey

633
00:30:27,257 --> 00:30:30,161
to discover the roots
of this ancient magic

634
00:30:30,178 --> 00:30:33,534
that's reappearing in the
kingdom throughout the seasons.

635
00:30:33,654 --> 00:30:36,580
And yet amid this loss
comes a small victory.

636
00:30:36,631 --> 00:30:38,654
Unlikely hero Samwell Tarly

637
00:30:38,655 --> 00:30:41,683
stumbles on a weakness
of the White Walkers.

638
00:30:41,803 --> 00:30:44,320
Samwell reaches for all he has to hand,

639
00:30:44,354 --> 00:30:47,530
an old dragonglass spear
he once found in the ground.

640
00:30:49,868 --> 00:30:52,737
To his astonishment it, it works.

641
00:30:53,331 --> 00:30:57,123
The spells are shattered
and it's melting before him.

642
00:30:58,142 --> 00:31:02,625
And stay with us to see wedded
bliss vanish, after the break.

643
00:31:02,834 --> 00:31:04,153
He's choking!

644
00:31:08,426 --> 00:31:11,636
Welcome back to Game of
Thrones: The Story So Far.

645
00:31:11,657 --> 00:31:14,670
We're in season four, a Royal
Wedding in King's Landing

646
00:31:14,698 --> 00:31:17,337
unites two great houses of Westeros,

647
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:19,729
the Tyrells and the Lannisters.

648
00:31:20,415 --> 00:31:22,331
Margaery and Joffrey's wedding

649
00:31:22,451 --> 00:31:24,963
is one of those weddings

650
00:31:24,991 --> 00:31:27,807
that we all have to go to where
there's no love in the room.

651
00:31:27,821 --> 00:31:30,467
The wedding brings another
great family into the game.

652
00:31:30,482 --> 00:31:33,382
The Martel's, represented
by Prince Oberyn.

653
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,257
We're the hottest couple at the wedding

654
00:31:35,568 --> 00:31:37,224
What else is there to say?

655
00:31:37,344 --> 00:31:40,471
- Ellaria Sand.
- My lord. My lady.

656
00:31:40,591 --> 00:31:43,300
- Charming.
- He has a zest for life,

657
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,633
and all the beautiful things
that the world has to offer.

658
00:31:45,753 --> 00:31:48,786
None of it is as
beautiful as his own rage

659
00:31:48,814 --> 00:31:50,280
and taste for revenge.

660
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:53,291
Oberyn is seeking vengeance
for his sister's brutal death

661
00:31:53,302 --> 00:31:55,594
- at the hands of the Lannisters.
- Rape and murder

662
00:31:55,617 --> 00:31:58,719
of women and children is
considered distasteful.

663
00:32:00,326 --> 00:32:02,964
Joffrey really uses
the wedding as an excuse

664
00:32:02,986 --> 00:32:05,634
- to be as horrible as he can.
- Uncle,

665
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,447
he can be my cup bearer.

666
00:32:08,713 --> 00:32:13,326
He sees it as an opportunity to
wield his power because he can.

667
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,849
And you're dying for
something to happen to him.

668
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,951
And so an unseen hand
poisons the newly wed King.

669
00:32:20,962 --> 00:32:23,457
- Idiots, help your king.
- Move away!

670
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,690
It's the moment of retribution
that the whole of the Seven Kingdoms

671
00:32:26,718 --> 00:32:28,449
- have been waiting for.
- Geoffrey!

672
00:32:28,483 --> 00:32:30,770
I think everybody who
watches Game of Thrones

673
00:32:30,781 --> 00:32:33,451
was hoping this day would come.

674
00:32:36,756 --> 00:32:38,924
I wanted to kill him in such a way

675
00:32:38,952 --> 00:32:41,900
that the viewers were
reminded that here's a

676
00:32:42,132 --> 00:32:44,408
13 year old boy who's dying.

677
00:32:44,634 --> 00:32:47,551
Though it is actually the Tyrells
that have poisoned Joffrey,

678
00:32:47,558 --> 00:32:49,815
it is Tyrion who is blamed.

679
00:32:50,196 --> 00:32:53,857
This is really the point
where Tyrion's fragile bonds

680
00:32:53,863 --> 00:32:55,436
with his family begin to unravel.

681
00:32:55,481 --> 00:32:56,704
Take him!

682
00:32:57,173 --> 00:32:58,594
Take Him!

683
00:32:59,035 --> 00:33:00,376
Take Him!

684
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:03,767
In plot terms, the death of Joffrey

685
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,540
is another shaking of the board
where the pieces are scattered

686
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:08,504
and also it's one of those things that

687
00:33:08,561 --> 00:33:13,577
elevate the whole series from
merely a story into a saga.

688
00:33:13,815 --> 00:33:15,824
As the royal family grows weaker,

689
00:33:15,841 --> 00:33:17,935
news from Westeros reaches Meereen

690
00:33:17,952 --> 00:33:19,910
where Daenerys has conquered the city,

691
00:33:19,949 --> 00:33:23,645
but she is not yet ready to
capitalize on her enemy's weakness.

692
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,852
King Joffrey Baratheon is dead.

693
00:33:27,533 --> 00:33:29,190
Murdered at his own wedding.

694
00:33:29,356 --> 00:33:31,574
This would appear to
be a really good time

695
00:33:31,591 --> 00:33:34,313
for her to finally make her
play for the Iron Throne.

696
00:33:34,341 --> 00:33:37,160
She has the dragons
and she has the army,

697
00:33:37,205 --> 00:33:39,105
and she has the strength of character.

698
00:33:39,114 --> 00:33:41,296
But actually she has
new responsibilities now,

699
00:33:41,306 --> 00:33:43,320
when she has unfinished
business where she is,

700
00:33:43,348 --> 00:33:45,960
and she's still trying
to learn how to rule.

701
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,307
And to compound matters,
her dragons have grown so big

702
00:33:49,347 --> 00:33:52,109
that Daenerys has started
to lose control of them.

703
00:33:52,472 --> 00:33:53,531
No!

704
00:33:55,745 --> 00:33:57,977
As they get bigger,
as her power increases,

705
00:33:57,991 --> 00:33:59,675
the harder it is for her to manage.

706
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,257
And that's where the
story then has to go.

707
00:34:04,298 --> 00:34:06,403
All they're going to
bring is complexity.

708
00:34:06,634 --> 00:34:09,758
And when one of the dragons
kills a child and abandons her,

709
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,719
Daenerys is left with no other choice

710
00:34:11,732 --> 00:34:13,254
but to chain the other two.

711
00:34:13,308 --> 00:34:15,482
She's just locked up her dragons, so

712
00:34:15,532 --> 00:34:18,104
can she unleash them again,
and will they forgive her?

713
00:34:19,602 --> 00:34:21,858
Without the mighty force of her dragons,

714
00:34:21,885 --> 00:34:23,642
Daenerys is faced with a dilemma

715
00:34:23,764 --> 00:34:25,479
as to what to do next.

716
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:28,454
She's definitely going through a sort of

717
00:34:28,473 --> 00:34:29,967
a dark night of the soul, I think,

718
00:34:29,998 --> 00:34:32,584
where she's trying to determine,

719
00:34:32,865 --> 00:34:34,408
have I got what it takes.

720
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:38,579
And so in season four, as
Daenerys remains in exile,

721
00:34:38,638 --> 00:34:40,196
across the Narrow Sea,

722
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,125
Sansa Stark has fled the capital

723
00:34:42,143 --> 00:34:44,488
and taken refuge with her aunt Lysa,

724
00:34:44,507 --> 00:34:47,010
who has been seduced by an arch schemer.

725
00:34:49,483 --> 00:34:52,639
Littlefinger is playing
a very chaotic game

726
00:34:53,014 --> 00:34:54,554
and he thrives on that.

727
00:34:54,898 --> 00:34:56,673
Oh, my sweet wife.

728
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:01,481
For Littlefinger, it's all
about getting power I think,

729
00:35:01,601 --> 00:35:03,895
and using Lysa as a pawn along the way.

730
00:35:05,421 --> 00:35:07,585
Sansa has witnessed Lysa's murder,

731
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,016
and covers for Littlefinger.

732
00:35:11,415 --> 00:35:14,201
Sansa's one of these
pure characters who's been

733
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:17,491
mistreated all through the series.

734
00:35:17,514 --> 00:35:20,932
She's seen a lot of horrible,
horrible things happen

735
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:22,970
and she's never been
able to take control

736
00:35:22,983 --> 00:35:26,733
and this is the first time. Actually,
she's got nothing else to lose.

737
00:35:26,751 --> 00:35:28,471
When Sansa lied

738
00:35:28,897 --> 00:35:34,538
to protect Littlefinger, I
cheered. I thought thank God girl.

739
00:35:34,728 --> 00:35:36,670
He tried to reason with her,

740
00:35:36,688 --> 00:35:39,500
promised her she was the only
one he'd ever loved but...

741
00:35:40,197 --> 00:35:43,517
she stepped through those doors..

742
00:35:45,242 --> 00:35:48,578
What you discover, is that she's
been learning this entire time.

743
00:35:48,582 --> 00:35:50,431
She's been listening,
she's been watching.

744
00:35:54,238 --> 00:35:57,765
She's been taking
Littlefinger's lessons to heart.

745
00:35:58,549 --> 00:36:01,280
So from one Stark protégé to another,

746
00:36:01,346 --> 00:36:04,343
Sansa's sister Arya is
still the Hound's hostage

747
00:36:04,365 --> 00:36:06,561
but they're now on an equal footing.

748
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,317
Who would pass the bloody gate?

749
00:36:09,487 --> 00:36:12,571
The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane.

750
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,107
He's her captor but
he's also her protector

751
00:36:15,163 --> 00:36:18,344
and you know she's seen his own pain

752
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,801
and his own fear at times and

753
00:36:20,818 --> 00:36:23,172
they've shared some
dangerous situations.

754
00:36:23,243 --> 00:36:25,603
But when The Hound is
gravely injured in battle,

755
00:36:25,614 --> 00:36:28,034
Arya is forced to strike out on her own.

756
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:30,174
Fuck it. I'm ready.

757
00:36:32,433 --> 00:36:34,415
Now he's wounded and he's dying

758
00:36:34,737 --> 00:36:36,888
and she's remembering
all he said about mercy

759
00:36:36,899 --> 00:36:38,313
and he's asking for mercy

760
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:42,197
and by mercy he means, you
know, a quick thrust to kill him.

761
00:36:42,618 --> 00:36:45,657
And she doesn't give it to him.

762
00:36:46,732 --> 00:36:47,917
Kill me.

763
00:36:48,037 --> 00:36:50,526
She won't put him out of his misery,

764
00:36:50,548 --> 00:36:52,628
she won't give him the easy way out,

765
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:55,920
she's going to leave
him there to suffer.

766
00:36:56,094 --> 00:36:59,544
Another wandering Stark is
Arya's crippled brother, Bran,

767
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,190
who has made it north of the Wall

768
00:37:01,218 --> 00:37:03,200
in search of the three-eyed Raven

769
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,311
who he believes will
help him walk again.

770
00:37:05,322 --> 00:37:08,881
All the time aided by his loyal
traveling companion, Hodor.

771
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:12,260
I think Hodor's more
than just Bran's legs.

772
00:37:13,876 --> 00:37:17,260
I think he means a lot to
Bran, you know, someone...

773
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,191
he's always been there through
absolutely everything, you know,

774
00:37:20,415 --> 00:37:22,662
even though he can't speak,
he can only say one word,

775
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:24,675
he's always someone
that's looking after them.

776
00:37:25,823 --> 00:37:26,967
You know, in a world of evil,

777
00:37:26,985 --> 00:37:29,120
he's probably one of the only good ones.

778
00:37:30,238 --> 00:37:33,193
Clearly Bran is very
important because he's trekked

779
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:36,377
all the way up north to a
cave where this, this raven

780
00:37:36,407 --> 00:37:39,034
has been summoning him for
the past couple of seasons, and

781
00:37:39,283 --> 00:37:41,619
now he's in this cave
with the three-eyed raven.

782
00:37:41,689 --> 00:37:43,104
Really we're gonna find out

783
00:37:43,126 --> 00:37:45,720
what, what the grand scheme
of things is for Bran.

784
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:47,930
You'll never walk again.

785
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,506
But you will fly.

786
00:37:53,165 --> 00:37:57,205
His powers, he's getting
stronger and there's gonna be some

787
00:37:57,472 --> 00:37:59,331
really exciting things happening

788
00:37:59,353 --> 00:38:01,596
and we're gonna find out
more and more about him.

789
00:38:01,798 --> 00:38:03,949
At the Wall, the Night's Watch suffers

790
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:06,182
a huge wildling attack at Castle Black,

791
00:38:06,236 --> 00:38:09,762
but in season four they
get a powerful new ally.

792
00:38:09,942 --> 00:38:12,355
Stannis Baratheon, who's
been away licking his wounds

793
00:38:12,377 --> 00:38:15,865
after the Blackwater defeat,
joins them with his vast army.

794
00:38:16,269 --> 00:38:18,632
The Battle of the Blackwater was a huge

795
00:38:18,654 --> 00:38:21,208
and crushing defeat at
the end of season two

796
00:38:21,405 --> 00:38:24,821
and it's taken them
basically two seasons

797
00:38:24,827 --> 00:38:26,339
to sort of rebuild from that,

798
00:38:26,459 --> 00:38:29,914
and his arrival means that
Jon Snow could have a new ally

799
00:38:29,925 --> 00:38:32,823
in the battle against the
White Walkers beyond the Wall.

800
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:35,368
If my father had seen
the things that I've seen,

801
00:38:35,586 --> 00:38:38,101
he'd also tell you to burn
the dead before nightfall.

802
00:38:39,913 --> 00:38:41,032
All of them.

803
00:38:41,098 --> 00:38:44,749
Season four draws to a mighty
climax in King's Landing

804
00:38:44,766 --> 00:38:48,025
when the ultimate father-and-son
showdown comes to a head.

805
00:38:48,096 --> 00:38:50,071
Tyrion is tried for murder.

806
00:38:50,115 --> 00:38:53,199
I'm guilty... of being a dwarf.

807
00:38:54,203 --> 00:38:58,831
- You're not on trial for being a dwarf.
- Oh, yes I am.

808
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:02,603
I've been on trial for
that my entire life.

809
00:39:02,636 --> 00:39:05,349
He's put on trial for a
murder he doesn't commit.

810
00:39:05,403 --> 00:39:07,679
His father deserts him and betrays him.

811
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,611
I demand a trial by combat!

812
00:39:11,785 --> 00:39:13,887
I mean, trial by combat,
you can get someone

813
00:39:13,909 --> 00:39:17,102
to fight for your honor, so
whether you're wrong or not,

814
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:20,009
as long as they win the
fight that's what matters.

815
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:22,740
He names Oberyn Martell as his champion.

816
00:39:22,745 --> 00:39:24,405
The one thing that he's ever lived for,

817
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,762
is to avenge his sister's death

818
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:30,174
and he knows that now that the
opportunity is presenting itself,

819
00:39:30,294 --> 00:39:32,751
there is no question that
he will get what he wants.

820
00:39:32,926 --> 00:39:36,218
You killed her children!

821
00:39:38,663 --> 00:39:40,819
And he does get what he wants by

822
00:39:40,857 --> 00:39:43,793
forcing a confession out of him.

823
00:39:44,765 --> 00:39:47,542
It's not exactly how he expected it.

824
00:39:47,602 --> 00:39:49,317
I killed her children.

825
00:39:49,339 --> 00:39:51,642
He still technically got
what he wanted, you know.

826
00:39:51,669 --> 00:39:53,307
Then I raped her.

827
00:39:54,339 --> 00:39:57,273
Then I smashed her head in like this!

828
00:39:59,017 --> 00:40:00,687
But when Oberyn is defeated,

829
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:02,821
Tyrion is sentenced to death.

830
00:40:03,825 --> 00:40:06,336
In Westeros the pursuit of justice is

831
00:40:06,456 --> 00:40:08,798
as futile as anything else.

832
00:40:08,863 --> 00:40:11,210
Oh, get on with it, you son of a whore.

833
00:40:12,057 --> 00:40:13,645
Is that any way to
speak about our mother?

834
00:40:14,022 --> 00:40:17,399
Tyrion is released from
jail by his brother Jaime

835
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,939
and told to go and board
a ship and run away.

836
00:40:19,993 --> 00:40:22,766
Instead he decides to
check in on his father.

837
00:40:24,163 --> 00:40:26,013
But it's his former lover Shae

838
00:40:26,045 --> 00:40:28,259
that he discovers in Tywin's bed.

839
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,848
Tyrion then kills Shae in
a sort of fit of jealousy

840
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:35,549
and then takes a crossbow
and goes to find his father.

841
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:36,925
Tyrion.

842
00:40:38,928 --> 00:40:40,276
Put down the crossbow.

843
00:40:41,204 --> 00:40:42,886
It's so tightly wound, this scene.

844
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,772
This is someone who spent his whole life

845
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:51,346
trying to win his approbation,
as much as he hated him,

846
00:40:51,373 --> 00:40:53,911
he really wanted that, you know.

847
00:40:54,031 --> 00:40:56,014
Obviously that's never gonna happen now

848
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:58,415
because he put a crossbow
bolt in his groin.

849
00:41:00,872 --> 00:41:03,192
What it means, is when a
big character like that goes,

850
00:41:03,203 --> 00:41:05,871
there's gonna be a power
vacuum and there's gonna be

851
00:41:05,991 --> 00:41:08,671
hustling and jostling
to get into his place.

852
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:10,735
I am the queen!

853
00:41:10,806 --> 00:41:13,557
I am the queen! Have you lost your mind?

854
00:41:13,573 --> 00:41:16,073
Join us after the break,
we're in season five

855
00:41:16,101 --> 00:41:19,201
and new power rises in King's Landing.

856
00:41:25,511 --> 00:41:27,815
Welcome back to the Story So Far.

857
00:41:27,853 --> 00:41:31,707
Where in season five, a Royal
Wedding unsettles Cersei.

858
00:41:32,482 --> 00:41:34,720
Her son Tommen is now king

859
00:41:34,736 --> 00:41:37,930
and has fallen under the spell
of his new Queen, Margaery,

860
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:39,534
much to Cersei's dismay.

861
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:41,609
When Margaery come in his life,

862
00:41:41,805 --> 00:41:44,600
I think he was just
enjoying life so much.

863
00:41:44,611 --> 00:41:47,035
Judging from the King's enthusiasm,

864
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:49,678
the Queen Mother will be
a queen grandmother soon.

865
00:41:49,689 --> 00:41:51,644
- Wouldn't that be a lovely day.
- Him being King

866
00:41:51,671 --> 00:41:54,127
was just a whole new
excitement, a whole new life.

867
00:41:55,301 --> 00:41:57,113
Cersei empowers religious fanatics

868
00:41:57,129 --> 00:41:59,591
to help her topple her
rival, Queen Margaery.

869
00:41:59,711 --> 00:42:02,140
You can't do this. I am The Queen!

870
00:42:02,167 --> 00:42:04,586
She brings back the faith
militant because she's, like, well

871
00:42:04,624 --> 00:42:07,075
hopefully I can clear
the board with these guys

872
00:42:07,102 --> 00:42:09,226
and regain some of my power.

873
00:42:09,346 --> 00:42:12,183
But Cersei's engineered
her own downfall.

874
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,180
Royalty is no longer above the law

875
00:42:14,186 --> 00:42:16,697
and fanatics come for her next.

876
00:42:17,161 --> 00:42:19,475
There's another contender to power

877
00:42:19,481 --> 00:42:21,632
in Westeros and it's... it's religion.

878
00:42:21,659 --> 00:42:23,232
It's the power of the faith.

879
00:42:23,718 --> 00:42:27,009
They want to remove all the excesses,

880
00:42:27,888 --> 00:42:31,398
to strip Cersei of all her finery,

881
00:42:31,595 --> 00:42:34,750
and encourage her, in inverted commas,

882
00:42:35,137 --> 00:42:36,840
to become clean.

883
00:42:36,867 --> 00:42:38,559
A sinner comes before you.

884
00:42:38,619 --> 00:42:41,676
Watching Cersei do the
walk of atonement...

885
00:42:41,747 --> 00:42:44,563
something happened that I
thought would never happen

886
00:42:45,049 --> 00:42:46,621
and that is I felt compassion.

887
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:49,394
No matter what she'd done previously,

888
00:42:49,421 --> 00:42:50,868
she didn't deserve this.

889
00:42:51,173 --> 00:42:53,821
And so season 5 sees her left naked

890
00:42:53,859 --> 00:42:57,745
before her subjects to
atone for her infidelities.

891
00:42:59,453 --> 00:43:02,259
The walk of shame was tough
was very, very tough for her.

892
00:43:02,292 --> 00:43:05,436
Very, very few women could
have done what she did,

893
00:43:05,452 --> 00:43:06,963
complete that walk.

894
00:43:07,214 --> 00:43:08,721
And you see her

895
00:43:08,945 --> 00:43:12,526
trying to maintain this regal presence

896
00:43:13,001 --> 00:43:14,317
but she can't.

897
00:43:14,355 --> 00:43:16,424
Stripped down to her literally,

898
00:43:16,435 --> 00:43:18,941
physically and emotionally
and psychologically

899
00:43:18,968 --> 00:43:20,955
stripped down to her most vulnerable,

900
00:43:20,972 --> 00:43:24,301
and then swept up into the
arms of the Beast that she,

901
00:43:24,421 --> 00:43:26,179
that she invited into the world.

902
00:43:26,299 --> 00:43:29,810
The strange creation
that is her new knight.

903
00:43:30,432 --> 00:43:32,998
It's just a brilliant twist.

904
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:38,100
Also getting a new ally
in season five is Daenerys,

905
00:43:38,106 --> 00:43:39,591
in the form of Tyrion.

906
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:42,423
After killing his father, he's
fled across the Narrow Sea,

907
00:43:43,269 --> 00:43:44,923
a fugitive on the run.

908
00:43:45,611 --> 00:43:47,047
He was a Lannister

909
00:43:47,101 --> 00:43:49,585
and he had all the money in the world

910
00:43:49,705 --> 00:43:53,662
and a noble name and a big bag of gold

911
00:43:53,782 --> 00:43:56,233
can buy you a lot. All that's gone now.

912
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,291
He's totally at the mercy of

913
00:43:58,324 --> 00:44:00,141
the people he's traveling with.

914
00:44:00,207 --> 00:44:02,838
- Who're you?
- And then the unthinkable happens.

915
00:44:02,958 --> 00:44:05,310
- I am the gift.
- He's captured and handed over

916
00:44:05,326 --> 00:44:07,265
to his family's greatest enemy,

917
00:44:07,281 --> 00:44:10,136
the Targaryen Queen
in Waiting, Daenerys.

918
00:44:10,322 --> 00:44:12,314
My name is Tyrion Lannister.

919
00:44:13,171 --> 00:44:17,886
And between them they are
an extraordinary force.

920
00:44:17,914 --> 00:44:19,289
Protect your queen!

921
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:21,609
She appoints him as
her political adviser

922
00:44:21,653 --> 00:44:23,502
but when a civil rebellion begins,

923
00:44:23,704 --> 00:44:28,468
Tyrion gets to witness Daenerys
transform into a true Targaryen.

924
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:33,141
The symbol of the Targaryen's
coming to claim their power

925
00:44:33,146 --> 00:44:35,607
is on the back of a dragon. 'Cos I mean,

926
00:44:36,011 --> 00:44:37,408
it's not much you can do

927
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:40,562
when you're standing on the ground
and a dragon's coming at you.

928
00:44:45,092 --> 00:44:47,280
She's had the dragons
now for quite a long time

929
00:44:47,281 --> 00:44:49,876
but her actually
becoming a dragon rider,

930
00:44:49,942 --> 00:44:51,383
that's her claiming her birthright

931
00:44:51,396 --> 00:44:53,719
more than I think anything
else we've seen her do because

932
00:44:53,759 --> 00:44:56,522
that is how the Targaryan's
wielded their power.

933
00:44:56,575 --> 00:44:57,610
<i>Vlar!</i>

934
00:44:58,715 --> 00:45:01,265
Everybody painted that
picture of Daenerys

935
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:03,169
flying her dragon, had
never really happened,

936
00:45:03,553 --> 00:45:05,737
and I've waited so
many years to see that

937
00:45:05,764 --> 00:45:07,949
and she finally does and
she does it in a wicked way

938
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,876
where she's escaping death.

939
00:45:11,732 --> 00:45:14,107
Daenerys, she's got
the greatest name ever.

940
00:45:14,138 --> 00:45:17,213
Stormborn, Mother of Dragons.

941
00:45:17,282 --> 00:45:20,479
Daenerys Stormborn
Targaryen, I love that name.

942
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,321
She's got these dragons as backup

943
00:45:22,441 --> 00:45:24,182
and then she's got Tyrion,

944
00:45:24,302 --> 00:45:26,160
who knows King's Landing,

945
00:45:26,234 --> 00:45:28,841
who knows the political side of things,

946
00:45:28,845 --> 00:45:31,002
and he's been through battles as well.

947
00:45:31,273 --> 00:45:33,189
Yet as season five ends,

948
00:45:33,229 --> 00:45:37,205
Daenerys' dragon delivers
her to an uncertain fate.

949
00:45:38,025 --> 00:45:39,754
The last thing we see of
Daenerys in season five,

950
00:45:39,755 --> 00:45:42,578
she's surrounded by Dothraki,
back where she bloody started.

951
00:45:47,469 --> 00:45:50,351
In season five is one
of vengeance for Arya.

952
00:45:50,389 --> 00:45:52,932
The young Stark follows
her mentor to Braavos

953
00:45:52,976 --> 00:45:55,662
- to become an assassin.
- To serve well,

954
00:45:56,666 --> 00:45:58,396
a girl must become no-one.

955
00:45:58,626 --> 00:46:01,999
Arya's relationship with
Jaqen is fascinating.

956
00:46:02,266 --> 00:46:05,160
He is utterly mysterious

957
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,705
and she is seduced by his power.

958
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:13,151
I didn't come here to sweep floors.

959
00:46:13,752 --> 00:46:14,785
No?

960
00:46:15,264 --> 00:46:16,580
Why come then?

961
00:46:17,131 --> 00:46:19,762
- You said I could be your apprentice.
- The power of death,

962
00:46:19,882 --> 00:46:22,055
the power to choose who dies.

963
00:46:22,115 --> 00:46:25,450
And Arya uses her new skills
to slaughter Meryn Trant,

964
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:28,476
a name on her kill list of
people who've destroyed her world.

965
00:46:29,038 --> 00:46:31,746
Arya, I think has crossed a line,

966
00:46:31,757 --> 00:46:34,071
and if you look back to season one,

967
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:36,752
what would Ned Stark
think of Arya's actions.

968
00:46:36,872 --> 00:46:38,957
Is that what he would
want for his daughter?

969
00:46:40,977 --> 00:46:43,373
There is a sense of vengeance

970
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:46,064
rather than a sense of justice.

971
00:46:46,676 --> 00:46:48,733
As Arya explores vengeance,

972
00:46:48,755 --> 00:46:51,910
back home the battle is on
for the Stark family home.

973
00:46:51,959 --> 00:46:54,437
Stannis Baratheon is
marching on Winterfell,

974
00:46:54,448 --> 00:46:56,451
now held by the Bolton's.

975
00:46:57,558 --> 00:47:00,648
But sometimes sacrifices must
be made to ensure victory.

976
00:47:00,668 --> 00:47:03,803
He's going after something and it is,

977
00:47:04,032 --> 00:47:06,603
it's increasingly futile.

978
00:47:06,843 --> 00:47:07,990
In a desperate move,

979
00:47:08,022 --> 00:47:10,380
Stannis follows the
advice of the red priestess

980
00:47:10,385 --> 00:47:11,936
who promises him victory

981
00:47:12,001 --> 00:47:14,993
if he makes an unspeakable
offering to the Lord of Light.

982
00:47:15,113 --> 00:47:17,777
She managed to convince him
to burn his own daughter.

983
00:47:17,809 --> 00:47:21,017
That's one of the most chilling
scenes, I think, of season five,

984
00:47:21,974 --> 00:47:24,329
when, when he burns his child.

985
00:47:24,364 --> 00:47:28,076
She's believed in this god
for so many years I think that

986
00:47:28,196 --> 00:47:30,003
if it's not to do with
the god she kind of just

987
00:47:30,508 --> 00:47:31,813
blocks everything out

988
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:33,935
and I think that's what
happened as she blocked out

989
00:47:33,937 --> 00:47:36,299
the fact that she was going
to be sacrificing a child.

990
00:47:36,473 --> 00:47:38,313
She was sacrificing the King's blood.

991
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,563
Melisandre really thought
that Stannis would be the one

992
00:47:43,574 --> 00:47:45,436
and you know she's put a
lot of her heart and soul

993
00:47:45,449 --> 00:47:47,847
and everything else
into, into helping him.

994
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:50,436
But it proves to be his undoing.

995
00:47:50,471 --> 00:47:51,712
His men desert him,

996
00:47:51,725 --> 00:47:53,929
and Melisandre, realizing all is lost,

997
00:47:53,947 --> 00:47:56,025
- flees to Castle Black,
- Your Grace.

998
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:58,872
leaving Stannis to advance
to Winterfell on his own.

999
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:00,085
Speak up.

1000
00:48:00,121 --> 00:48:01,536
Can't be worse than mutiny.

1001
00:48:01,557 --> 00:48:03,505
He's had a rough old
time, Stannis, hasn't he.

1002
00:48:03,579 --> 00:48:05,517
Because really he
should be the king from

1003
00:48:05,534 --> 00:48:07,661
after Robert Baratheon dies,

1004
00:48:07,844 --> 00:48:09,927
but every battle he loses he becomes

1005
00:48:09,958 --> 00:48:14,036
further and further involved
with this kind of fantasy.

1006
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:16,176
And awaiting Stannis at Winterfell

1007
00:48:16,194 --> 00:48:19,067
are the Bolton's who tried to
cement their position in the north

1008
00:48:19,074 --> 00:48:21,432
with a tactical marriage to Sansa Stark,

1009
00:48:21,702 --> 00:48:24,843
orchestrated by master
manipulator Petyr Baelish.

1010
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:26,441
She shouldn't trust Littlefinger,

1011
00:48:26,463 --> 00:48:29,865
I mean why are you gonna trust
Littlefinger, I mean, geez!

1012
00:48:30,084 --> 00:48:33,648
He is the dodgy car
salesman in Game of Thrones,

1013
00:48:33,768 --> 00:48:36,284
offers you everything
and gives you nothing.

1014
00:48:36,912 --> 00:48:38,604
May I introduce my son,

1015
00:48:39,314 --> 00:48:40,471
Ramsay Bolton.

1016
00:48:41,372 --> 00:48:43,112
Now that the Bolton's have kind of

1017
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:44,579
established themselves at Winterfell,

1018
00:48:44,606 --> 00:48:49,157
bringing in a Stark will really
solidify their position in the north.

1019
00:48:49,277 --> 00:48:51,227
But it's a huge miscalculation

1020
00:48:51,266 --> 00:48:53,935
that traps her in another
brutal relationship.

1021
00:48:53,952 --> 00:48:59,314
Ramsay is a horrible, cruel,
evil, power-hungry man.

1022
00:48:59,349 --> 00:49:03,049
He took psychotic
nature to another level.

1023
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:05,249
I mean he went there, and he went some.

1024
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:06,560
Oh, no no no.

1025
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:09,259
You stay here Reek.

1026
00:49:10,434 --> 00:49:11,765
You watch.

1027
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:16,906
Fellow-prisoner Theon Greyjoy
aka Reek is too terrified to help.

1028
00:49:17,946 --> 00:49:20,192
I think we all thought he should
have stepped in on the wedding night.

1029
00:49:20,206 --> 00:49:21,165
Let's be frank.

1030
00:49:21,185 --> 00:49:22,888
With Ramsay distracted by battle,

1031
00:49:22,907 --> 00:49:25,816
- You're leaving it to me?
- Sansa is caught attempting to escape,

1032
00:49:25,936 --> 00:49:28,427
and it's only then that
Reek finds the courage

1033
00:49:28,449 --> 00:49:30,090
to become Theon again.

1034
00:49:31,758 --> 00:49:33,881
Stop! Stop!

1035
00:49:34,675 --> 00:49:36,702
I think that was a moment
that we all needed to see,

1036
00:49:36,736 --> 00:49:40,174
Theon again had been so
much at the mercy of Ramsey,

1037
00:49:40,188 --> 00:49:43,770
that finally he had a moment
where he could do good.

1038
00:49:44,111 --> 00:49:46,308
And so by the end of season five,

1039
00:49:46,328 --> 00:49:49,929
Sansa has jumped either to
her death or to her freedom.

1040
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,284
It's someone

1041
00:49:54,513 --> 00:49:58,492
being pushed in every
way to the absolute limit

1042
00:49:58,612 --> 00:50:02,127
of their will to live and

1043
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:05,216
having come through that,

1044
00:50:05,895 --> 00:50:08,789
she's obviously gonna be
quite a different person.

1045
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:13,527
As Sansa and Theon leap
from the walls of Winterfell,

1046
00:50:13,544 --> 00:50:17,504
nearby Stannis is facing
defeat by the vast Bolton army.

1047
00:50:19,896 --> 00:50:21,304
I think Stannis had given up.

1048
00:50:21,424 --> 00:50:23,100
I think even before
they'd gone into battle,

1049
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:24,383
I think he was going there to die.

1050
00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:26,924
Fate finally catches up with Stannis

1051
00:50:26,985 --> 00:50:29,461
when he comes face-to-face
with Brienne of Tarth

1052
00:50:29,535 --> 00:50:32,549
who sought vengeance for
Renly's death since season two.

1053
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:36,941
She is probably the
toughest person going about,

1054
00:50:37,699 --> 00:50:39,072
about Westeros.

1055
00:50:48,969 --> 00:50:50,474
But as Stannis bows out,

1056
00:50:50,537 --> 00:50:52,968
Jon Snow comes up against a greater foe

1057
00:50:53,088 --> 00:50:54,610
when he ventures to Hardhome

1058
00:50:54,636 --> 00:50:56,369
to make peace with the Wildlings.

1059
00:50:57,125 --> 00:50:58,732
This alliance is sacrilege,

1060
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:00,780
but when the White Walkers
launch a full attack,

1061
00:51:00,863 --> 00:51:02,886
Jon sees his hunch is right.

1062
00:51:02,929 --> 00:51:05,235
All humans must unite to fight them.

1063
00:51:06,327 --> 00:51:09,025
What's so great about the
whole White Walker mythology

1064
00:51:09,034 --> 00:51:12,043
is the way it has been
building throughout the series.

1065
00:51:12,466 --> 00:51:15,068
Who knows what they
want. They would bring

1066
00:51:15,188 --> 00:51:18,615
death and destruction
to absolutely everything.

1067
00:51:21,655 --> 00:51:23,806
Up until this point they've been

1068
00:51:23,841 --> 00:51:26,147
semi-mythical characters. It's been

1069
00:51:26,186 --> 00:51:28,103
the White Walkers in those cold lands

1070
00:51:28,138 --> 00:51:29,344
that no one ever goes to

1071
00:51:29,706 --> 00:51:32,217
and here they are in
front of the heroes,

1072
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:33,632
then they're very real

1073
00:51:34,077 --> 00:51:35,890
and it's a very real danger.

1074
00:51:37,758 --> 00:51:40,483
I don't think the White
Walkers are afraid of anything.

1075
00:51:40,641 --> 00:51:45,667
I think fear is just
not in their vocabulary.

1076
00:51:47,658 --> 00:51:49,960
And then Jon and the
viewers see the Night's King

1077
00:51:49,963 --> 00:51:52,371
reveal that he has a greater power.

1078
00:51:53,424 --> 00:51:56,175
He can raise and recruit the dead.

1079
00:51:58,325 --> 00:51:59,930
It's a challenge to Jon,

1080
00:51:59,969 --> 00:52:01,884
and 'look what I can do'.

1081
00:52:05,252 --> 00:52:07,397
Forget all the other
battles that are going on,

1082
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:10,999
you know, battles for castles
and, and kingship, you know,

1083
00:52:11,042 --> 00:52:12,936
he's got to focus his army.

1084
00:52:13,237 --> 00:52:15,460
But on Jon's return to Castle Black

1085
00:52:15,498 --> 00:52:17,757
in the final minutes of season 5,

1086
00:52:17,774 --> 00:52:20,149
viewers witness the cruelest blow of all

1087
00:52:20,202 --> 00:52:21,830
in a gut churning finale.

1088
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:24,874
When I saw the cross with traitor
written on it, I thought oh

1089
00:52:25,922 --> 00:52:28,616
no, they're not gonna kill him

1090
00:52:30,367 --> 00:52:32,336
and then they did!

1091
00:52:34,856 --> 00:52:36,048
For the Watch.

1092
00:52:36,318 --> 00:52:37,462
You root for him

1093
00:52:37,685 --> 00:52:39,429
but the great thing
about Game of Thrones

1094
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:41,423
is your heroes can die any second.

1095
00:52:46,392 --> 00:52:47,405
For The Watch.

1096
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,698
They're all members of
the Night's Watch and

1097
00:52:49,706 --> 00:52:52,078
no matter what one of
their brothers has done,

1098
00:52:52,689 --> 00:52:55,746
what they did was
worse than what he did.

1099
00:52:56,375 --> 00:53:00,043
And so season 5 ends
on betrayal and death.

1100
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:02,491
Is this really the end for Jon Snow?

1101
00:53:02,548 --> 00:53:06,181
Only season six holds the
answer, after the break.

1102
00:53:12,832 --> 00:53:14,998
Welcome back to the Story So Far,

1103
00:53:15,021 --> 00:53:18,208
where season six begins
at the scene of a crime.

1104
00:53:18,808 --> 00:53:21,252
Jon snow lies slain at Castle Black

1105
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:23,626
and all hopes are pinned
on the red priestess

1106
00:53:23,664 --> 00:53:25,880
and her magic to bring him back.

1107
00:53:27,053 --> 00:53:29,483
Game of Thrones needs Jon Snow.

1108
00:53:29,794 --> 00:53:33,314
We do, we need him to
finish what he started.

1109
00:53:33,434 --> 00:53:35,595
As viewers hope for Jon's resurrection,

1110
00:53:35,617 --> 00:53:39,198
we learn that Melisandre
harbors a great secret.

1111
00:53:39,318 --> 00:53:40,857
The reveal of ancient Melisandre

1112
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:43,450
was definitely one of the
most stunning surprises

1113
00:53:43,461 --> 00:53:45,303
in season six of Game of Thrones.

1114
00:53:46,463 --> 00:53:49,131
It shows how much older she actually is

1115
00:53:49,145 --> 00:53:52,419
and how much longer she's
been believing in this god for.

1116
00:53:52,754 --> 00:53:55,701
Then we see her use this power for Jon.

1117
00:53:55,981 --> 00:53:59,692
She tries to bring him back to us,
to resurrect him, it doesn't work.

1118
00:54:00,497 --> 00:54:03,791
When the wolf started to sort of
make some noise that's when I thought,

1119
00:54:03,832 --> 00:54:05,399
I think everyone thought,

1120
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,664
Jon Snow's alive.

1121
00:54:06,699 --> 00:54:08,145
And then he's just
like that moment of...

1122
00:54:09,232 --> 00:54:12,655
Jon Snow has returned and
all the Westeros rejoices.

1123
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,227
And after the miracle of Jon's rebirth,

1124
00:54:16,347 --> 00:54:19,118
comes a partial reunion
of scattered Starks

1125
00:54:19,161 --> 00:54:21,345
when Sansa arrives at Castle Black,

1126
00:54:21,362 --> 00:54:23,318
and together they'll gather forces

1127
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:25,265
in a bid to retake the north.

1128
00:54:28,811 --> 00:54:31,170
Sansa's become majestic but

1129
00:54:31,611 --> 00:54:33,960
she's also become savvy.

1130
00:54:33,986 --> 00:54:36,012
She's lost that naivety.

1131
00:54:36,132 --> 00:54:39,051
A monster has taken our home

1132
00:54:39,086 --> 00:54:40,392
and our brother.

1133
00:54:41,614 --> 00:54:44,169
We have to go back to
Winterfell and save them both.

1134
00:54:44,289 --> 00:54:46,775
She's a queen, really.

1135
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:49,836
In terms of being from a powerful family

1136
00:54:49,956 --> 00:54:51,390
and being able to make decisions

1137
00:54:51,407 --> 00:54:52,651
and tell other people to do stuff,

1138
00:54:52,673 --> 00:54:54,539
I think she's gonna tell
other people to do stuff.

1139
00:54:55,633 --> 00:54:57,646
And across the sea in season six,

1140
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:00,318
another young royal's in similar mood.

1141
00:55:00,438 --> 00:55:01,464
Daenerys,

1142
00:55:02,369 --> 00:55:04,190
who's been a hostage of the Dothraki,

1143
00:55:04,439 --> 00:55:07,303
burns their leaders
and converts the tribe.

1144
00:55:08,215 --> 00:55:10,578
The huge Dothraki horde.

1145
00:55:10,844 --> 00:55:12,892
_

1146
00:55:14,656 --> 00:55:18,708
We're gonna finally get a lot of

1147
00:55:19,101 --> 00:55:21,432
different power factions coming together

1148
00:55:21,511 --> 00:55:23,961
in a very scary explosive way.

1149
00:55:24,734 --> 00:55:26,542
And she also gets a navy,

1150
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:30,075
forging an alliance with
the Ironborn who bring ships.

1151
00:55:31,878 --> 00:55:34,223
But as Great Houses unite for war,

1152
00:55:34,262 --> 00:55:36,873
beyond the Wall we learn
more about the deathly foe

1153
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,458
which threatens them all.

1154
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:41,519
While time training
with a three-eyed Raven,

1155
00:55:41,554 --> 00:55:43,960
Bran Stark uncovers a great secret.

1156
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:47,397
White Walkers were
created from the first men.

1157
00:55:50,087 --> 00:55:51,567
The children of forest

1158
00:55:51,916 --> 00:55:54,467
invented the White Walkers to help

1159
00:55:54,641 --> 00:55:57,214
protect their own race.

1160
00:55:57,445 --> 00:56:00,057
It was an innocent defense

1161
00:56:00,219 --> 00:56:01,262
to do that.

1162
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:04,227
But clearly it has gone out of control.

1163
00:56:04,891 --> 00:56:06,949
And when the White
Walkers come for Bran,

1164
00:56:07,005 --> 00:56:09,253
there are terrible casualties.

1165
00:56:09,319 --> 00:56:10,685
Hodor is a goner.

1166
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,131
Hold the door!

1167
00:56:13,135 --> 00:56:16,460
A completely pure act of protection.

1168
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:17,691
There was nothing,

1169
00:56:17,979 --> 00:56:19,538
there was no greater goal

1170
00:56:20,062 --> 00:56:21,333
to what he did

1171
00:56:22,141 --> 00:56:23,796
other than protect Bran.

1172
00:56:25,303 --> 00:56:28,177
Everyone who's basically just given

1173
00:56:28,549 --> 00:56:31,866
in order to give way for Bran and

1174
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:34,224
there must be a reason, right?

1175
00:56:34,302 --> 00:56:36,800
We know he's become
the three-eyed Raven.

1176
00:56:40,106 --> 00:56:42,430
But how's he going to use those powers.

1177
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:44,940
And as the three-eyed Raven,

1178
00:56:44,953 --> 00:56:47,263
Bran resolves a great Stark secret

1179
00:56:47,307 --> 00:56:49,210
when he sees Jon Snow's mother

1180
00:56:49,241 --> 00:56:51,276
is Ned's sister, Lyanna.

1181
00:56:53,132 --> 00:56:55,542
You understand what Ned has been
going through the whole time.

1182
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:58,158
He made out that it was
his son, his bastard son,

1183
00:56:58,198 --> 00:56:59,765
but it was really his nephew.

1184
00:57:00,621 --> 00:57:03,953
But it confirms Jon
Snow is still half Stark

1185
00:57:04,073 --> 00:57:05,634
and in season six,

1186
00:57:05,669 --> 00:57:08,643
he and Sansa march on their
family seat of Winterfell

1187
00:57:08,678 --> 00:57:10,306
to fight Ramsay Bolton,

1188
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:14,267
in what goes down in history
as the Battle of the Bastards.

1189
00:57:16,328 --> 00:57:17,967
Ramsay's now top dog,

1190
00:57:17,989 --> 00:57:20,648
having murdered his
father and newborn brother.

1191
00:57:20,683 --> 00:57:22,273
Now, if you want to save...

1192
00:57:22,281 --> 00:57:23,984
You're going to die
tomorrow, Lord Bolton.

1193
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,080
When you play the Game of Thrones,

1194
00:57:26,089 --> 00:57:28,975
you either win or you die,
you know, and she knows

1195
00:57:29,014 --> 00:57:30,241
it's about winning now;

1196
00:57:30,272 --> 00:57:33,319
she's had enough of all
the rest; it's time to win.

1197
00:57:33,795 --> 00:57:35,577
She offers her insight.

1198
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:38,005
You think he's going to fall
into your trap, he won't.

1199
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:39,521
He's the one who lays traps.

1200
00:57:39,534 --> 00:57:43,149
She's lived with this man for
a long time and she knows that,

1201
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:46,647
he is cruel to the core.

1202
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:49,422
- Sansa's words go unheeded.
- Let's play a game.

1203
00:57:49,457 --> 00:57:52,440
Ramsay baits Jon with
his hostage Rickon.

1204
00:57:52,767 --> 00:57:53,894
Run to your brother.

1205
00:57:54,409 --> 00:57:57,619
It shows a lot about
how Ramsay's mind works.

1206
00:57:58,042 --> 00:58:01,440
He's calculating; he's always
thinking about the next move,

1207
00:58:01,628 --> 00:58:05,392
you know it's very interesting how
Machiavellian he can be as well.

1208
00:58:08,404 --> 00:58:10,395
Ramsay Bolton's, like, yes

1209
00:58:10,515 --> 00:58:12,260
I've got you now boy,

1210
00:58:13,112 --> 00:58:15,374
just in the middle of no man's land.

1211
00:58:17,278 --> 00:58:19,942
That's what Game of Thrones
does so brilliantly is, it,

1212
00:58:20,139 --> 00:58:24,947
it's constantly pitting good
moral forces against bad ones,

1213
00:58:24,969 --> 00:58:26,720
and you don't just win
because you're good.

1214
00:58:28,444 --> 00:58:31,239
They were surrounded by the entire army;

1215
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:33,673
they were being driven into the mud.

1216
00:58:33,717 --> 00:58:37,079
Ramsay should have won, he was much
more conniving, much more cunning,

1217
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:40,048
and if it hadn't have been for
Sansa coming in at the last minute,

1218
00:58:40,059 --> 00:58:42,210
then he probably would have won.

1219
00:58:42,821 --> 00:58:44,917
Now that Sansa has brought the cavalry,

1220
00:58:44,928 --> 00:58:46,179
the Knights of the Vale,

1221
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:49,203
it's a done deal that
the Starks are going home.

1222
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:53,950
This was probably the first

1223
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:57,375
major victory in, in six years.

1224
00:59:02,343 --> 00:59:04,450
They're suddenly inside the castle.

1225
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:06,076
Winterfell.

1226
00:59:06,403 --> 00:59:09,078
It seems Jon will kill Ramsay,

1227
00:59:10,551 --> 00:59:13,480
but he then leaves
Sansa to take the scalp.

1228
00:59:14,808 --> 00:59:16,250
There was only one way to kill him

1229
00:59:16,266 --> 00:59:18,376
and Sansa found the right way to do it.

1230
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,860
She knows what she's gonna do, and

1231
00:59:22,052 --> 00:59:23,450
she knows he deserves it.

1232
00:59:23,633 --> 00:59:25,933
All memory of you will disappear.

1233
00:59:32,243 --> 00:59:35,601
If you were face to
face with your nemesis

1234
00:59:35,806 --> 00:59:37,688
and you had the opportunity,

1235
00:59:37,937 --> 00:59:39,011
you'd take it.

1236
00:59:42,561 --> 00:59:44,307
She's hardcore.

1237
00:59:46,293 --> 00:59:48,739
She has the makings of a Cersei.

1238
00:59:49,442 --> 00:59:52,713
But it's Jon Snow who becomes
king as the season ends

1239
00:59:52,743 --> 00:59:54,953
with the Starks controlling the north

1240
00:59:55,001 --> 00:59:57,498
and for now Sansa is by his side.

1241
00:59:58,529 --> 01:00:01,093
She's a character that
will surprise people

1242
01:00:01,281 --> 01:00:03,333
because she's not what she seems.

1243
01:00:03,569 --> 01:00:06,041
And neither is Sansa's sister Arya.

1244
01:00:06,124 --> 01:00:09,176
Blinded and stabbed in her
training as a faceless man

1245
01:00:09,296 --> 01:00:12,608
she's now back in Westeros
to deal with Walder Frey.

1246
01:00:14,154 --> 01:00:16,022
She's gone on this mad journey.

1247
01:00:16,935 --> 01:00:18,525
Arya comes in disguise,

1248
01:00:18,551 --> 01:00:20,988
having chopped up Walder's sons.

1249
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,660
They weren't easy to carve.

1250
01:00:26,324 --> 01:00:30,058
She wanted him to see who she was.

1251
01:00:32,949 --> 01:00:34,631
The face comes off and there's a knife.

1252
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:36,740
The last thing you're ever going to see

1253
01:00:36,814 --> 01:00:39,857
is a Stark smiling
down at you as you die.

1254
01:00:39,906 --> 01:00:42,779
She's been caught up in it so young

1255
01:00:43,085 --> 01:00:45,783
that she's turning
into this child soldier.

1256
01:00:49,957 --> 01:00:52,768
Revenge is a dish best taken cold.

1257
01:00:52,838 --> 01:00:55,035
I literally cannot wait now

1258
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:57,035
for her and Cersei to face off.

1259
01:00:57,577 --> 01:01:01,755
In fact Cersei elevates revenge
to an art form in season six

1260
01:01:01,803 --> 01:01:05,042
as the Lannisters fight for
their family's very survival.

1261
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:08,864
These royal lovers are united in grief

1262
01:01:08,886 --> 01:01:11,217
after the Sand Snakes
killed their daughter.

1263
01:01:11,337 --> 01:01:13,912
The Lannisters are all about power.

1264
01:01:13,995 --> 01:01:15,770
They're all about revenge.

1265
01:01:15,841 --> 01:01:18,657
We're the only ones who matter,
the only ones in this world,

1266
01:01:19,216 --> 01:01:20,688
and everything they've taken from us

1267
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,535
we're going to take back and more.

1268
01:01:22,655 --> 01:01:24,815
It doesn't matter how long it takes,

1269
01:01:25,033 --> 01:01:26,727
they will get you back.

1270
01:01:26,847 --> 01:01:29,007
With Jamie sent away to fight revolt,

1271
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:32,674
Cersei is left alone to face
judgment by the faith militant.

1272
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:37,690
We are told that Cersei is
going to turn up for a trial but

1273
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:40,105
we know perfectly well
she's not going to.

1274
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:44,193
But it's now she plays
a game-changing hand.

1275
01:01:44,488 --> 01:01:47,239
She was always going to
have a dastardly plan.

1276
01:01:48,243 --> 01:01:51,299
The man who was sent by Cersei
to hold Tommen in that room...

1277
01:01:51,327 --> 01:01:52,702
There's something wrong.

1278
01:01:52,713 --> 01:01:55,912
Marjorie knows what's up in an instant.

1279
01:01:55,983 --> 01:01:59,121
The High Scept is packed with
those who've wronged Cersei.

1280
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:02,430
The Tyrells, High Sparrow
and faith militant.

1281
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:03,596
The amazing thing about Game of Thrones

1282
01:02:03,613 --> 01:02:05,168
is the spectacle is always incredible

1283
01:02:05,203 --> 01:02:06,722
and you never know it's coming.

1284
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,844
This isn't gonna end well.

1285
01:02:18,659 --> 01:02:21,695
Cersei has, of course,
unleashed wildfire.

1286
01:02:22,965 --> 01:02:25,751
She's wiped out this fantastic building;

1287
01:02:25,773 --> 01:02:27,707
she's destroyed all her enemies.

1288
01:02:28,096 --> 01:02:30,114
That's what makes Cersei so brilliant;

1289
01:02:30,234 --> 01:02:32,720
she's been to the absolute lowest place

1290
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:34,646
that you could possibly go

1291
01:02:34,707 --> 01:02:37,358
and she still comes out on top.

1292
01:02:38,371 --> 01:02:42,987
In the moment where she gets her
revenge on everyone else, she loses

1293
01:02:43,537 --> 01:02:47,074
the only thing that she has
left that matters to her.

1294
01:02:49,306 --> 01:02:51,345
Knowing that his mum's the one that's

1295
01:02:51,835 --> 01:02:53,856
pretty much murdered his wife,

1296
01:02:57,214 --> 01:02:58,725
what has he got to live for.

1297
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:02,340
Tommen's death leaves
the Iron Throne empty,

1298
01:03:02,366 --> 01:03:04,663
so a new reign begins.

1299
01:03:05,291 --> 01:03:07,029
A witch told her that she,

1300
01:03:07,047 --> 01:03:09,475
she was cursed and that all
of her children would die.

1301
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:11,544
It didn't stop her from loving her kids

1302
01:03:11,557 --> 01:03:14,776
and trying to protect them at any cost,

1303
01:03:15,143 --> 01:03:20,200
but she accepts very swiftly her fate.

1304
01:03:21,161 --> 01:03:23,960
And so Jamie returns
to a new world order,

1305
01:03:23,973 --> 01:03:25,636
courtesy of his sister.

1306
01:03:27,282 --> 01:03:29,999
She's devastated the Tyrells.

1307
01:03:30,003 --> 01:03:33,938
Now the Lannisters are once
more a force to be reckoned with.

1308
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:38,501
Queen Cersei, sitting
on the Iron Throne.

1309
01:03:40,572 --> 01:03:42,318
I think it's good to
see her on the throne,

1310
01:03:42,323 --> 01:03:44,711
because it really has been
her who's been pushing the men,

1311
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:48,220
and so she should be there,
right there or wrongly.

1312
01:03:48,632 --> 01:03:50,559
As one Queen takes the throne,

1313
01:03:50,603 --> 01:03:53,911
another sets sail to
challenge her for it.

1314
01:03:54,375 --> 01:03:56,984
Finally Daenerys, the Targaryen Queen

1315
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:58,938
is on her way to Westeros,

1316
01:03:58,959 --> 01:04:02,465
with a vast alliance she
spent six seasons amassing.

1317
01:04:03,813 --> 01:04:05,871
We're now getting to crunch time.

1318
01:04:06,249 --> 01:04:07,755
As she comes to conquer,

1319
01:04:07,804 --> 01:04:10,352
the burning question for season seven:

1320
01:04:10,472 --> 01:04:12,415
who might join her now?

1321
01:04:12,475 --> 01:04:16,659
Absolutely everybody against the
Lannisters, everyone against Cersei.

1322
01:04:16,684 --> 01:04:18,829
Like, Cersei doesn't have a chance.

1323
01:04:18,949 --> 01:04:21,093
But they'll fuck with us.

1324
01:04:22,669 --> 01:04:24,553
I do have this theory
that the White Walkers

1325
01:04:24,558 --> 01:04:26,528
will sit on the Iron Throne.

1326
01:04:29,127 --> 01:04:30,982
Just leave those dragons alone.
